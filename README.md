# Benford's Law Analysis – Air Quality Dataset

Welcome to the Benford's Law Analysis project! This repository contains our statistical analysis of an air quality dataset using **Benford’s Law** to investigate the authenticity and reliability of environmental data.

## Overview

Benford's Law is a mathematical principle that describes the expected distribution of first digits in naturally occurring datasets. According to the law, lower digits (like 1) appear more frequently than higher digits (like 9). It is a valuable tool for **data verification**, especially to detect manipulation or anomalies.

In this project, we analyzed air quality data metrics (average, minimum, and maximum pollutant values) to see how well they align with Benford’s distribution.

## Files

- `Benford_Law.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with complete code, visualizations, and statistical testing.
- `Benford's Law.pdf` – Summary presentation of our methodology, findings, and insights.

## Key Takeaways

- **Benford’s Law** is effective for verifying the authenticity of real-world datasets.
- Most pollutant data followed the expected digit pattern.
- The **maximum values** dataset raised flags and should be further analyzed.

## Tools Used

- Google Colab (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Canva for presentation design

## Visual Example

> Our plots visualize how closely each pollutant metric follows the expected logarithmic distribution.
